### Using this app

**Close DrawThings before running this app.** 
 - On first run, you bee asked the location of **Stash Directory**
 - Then app will copy all models from your Mac to the **Stash Directory**
 - This app will **always** copy/backup **all** your models to the **Stash Directory**
 - You can manage your (1) main models, (2) LoRa models and (3) ControlNet models - each has it's own view pane in the app.
 - You'll see two panes; **Your Mac** on the left and the **Stash Directory** on the right.
 - Mark models on **Your Mac** for deletion to save space, rename them and reorder them as you wish. 
 - Display order is controlled by the order of the JSON data files that DrawThings uses

 - When you're finished, hit the "Save" button and your Mac will be updated. 
 - Note: Only the display name for the models are changed - the model file names are never altered.
