# Quick Start

Run the Svelte test app:

```bash
cd svelte-test
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## What You'll See

✅ **Left sidebar** - Navigation (Models, LoRAs, ControlNets, Settings)
✅ **Two-pane layout** - Mac HD (left) | Stash (right)
✅ **Mock data** - Pre-populated with test models
✅ **Model cards** - Name, filename, file size
✅ **Modal** - Click any model to see details
✅ **Exact UI match** - Matches the current Next.js app design

## All Data is Mock

Everything is stored in `src/models.js` as JavaScript objects.
No backend, no database, no API calls - pure frontend!
